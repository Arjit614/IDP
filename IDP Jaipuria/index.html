  ISS(International Space Station) and in fact has it's
 own small space station.Since 2003, when Yang Liwei became the first Chinese national in space,
 CNSA has done several manned space launches. In 2013,
 a three-person crew aboard Shenzhou 9 made the first Chinese manned docking in space,
 attaching to the single-room station, Tiangong 1.
 The agency succeeded in making the first soft landing on the moon in
 decades in December 2014 with its Chang'e 3 lander and its rover, Yutu.

<h1>About it's logo</h1>
<p>CNSA's logo is a similar design to that of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.
 The arrow in the middle is similar to the Chinese character 人 which
 means 'human' or 'people', to state that humans are the center of all space exploration.
 The three concentric ellipses stand for three types of Escape Velocity
 (minimum speed needed to reach sustainable orbits, to escape the earth system,
 and to escape the solar system) which are milestones of space exploration.
 The second ring is drawn with a bold line, to state that China has passed
 the first stage of exploration (earth system) and is undergoing the second
 stage exploration (within the solar system). The 人 character stands above the three
 rings to emphasize humanity's capability to escape and explore.
 Olive branches were added to state that China's space exploration is peaceful in nature.
